Me not working hard?
Yeah, right, picture that with a Kodak
Or better yet, go to Times Square
Take a picture of me with a Kodak
Took my life from negative to positive
And I just want y'all to know that
And tonight, let's enjoy life
Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-Yo

Tonight, I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

Don't care what they say, or what games they play
Nothing is enough, 'til they handle love (let's do it tonight)
I want you tonight, I want you to stay
I want you tonight

Grab somebody sexy tell 'em hey (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)
Give me everything tonight

Take advantage of tonight (yeah)
'Cause tomorrow I'm off to Dubai to perform for a princess
But tonight, I can make you my queen and make love to you endless
This is insane, the way the name growin'
Money keep flowin', hustlers move in silence, so I'm tiptoein'
To keep flowin'
I got it locked up like Lindsay Lohan (woo)
Put it on my life, baby
I'll make you feel right, baby
Can't promise tomorrow, but I promise tonight
Dale

Excuse me (excuse me)
And I might drink a little more than I should tonight (tonight)
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight (tonight)
And baby, I'ma make you feel so good tonight
'Cause we might not get tomorrow

Tonight, I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

Don't care what they say, or what games they play
Nothing is enough, 'til they handle love (let's do it tonight)
I want you tonight, I want you to stay
I want you tonight

Grab somebody sexy tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

Reach for the stars, and if you don't grab them
At least you'll fall on top of the world
Think about it, 'cause if you slip I'm gon' fall on top of your girl, haha
What I'm involved with is deeper than the Masons
Baby, baby and it ain't no secret
My granny's from Cuba but I'm an American Idol gettin' money like Seacrest
Put it on my life, baby, I make you feel right, baby
Can't promise tomorrow but I promise tonight
Dale

Excuse me (excuse me)
And I might drink a little more than I should tonight (tonight)
